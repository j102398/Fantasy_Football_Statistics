Task Scheduler Setup


Step 1 - Find the details 


Edit line 286 of database-archive, which has the function task_schedule_details currently commented out. This will provide information which will help setting up the Task Scheduler, allowing for the program to automatically run in the background. 

This should produce an output which looks like this: 

  
  Python EXE     : C:\Path\To\Your\Python\Executable
  Architecture   : 64bit
  Path to arcpy  : Not found

Step 2 - Setup Task Scheduler

    1) Search Task Scheduler in Windows Search Bar in the bottom left of the screen, and click enter
    2) On the right hand side,click "Create Basic Task..."
    3) Give this a task a suitable name (e.g database-automation), and description if you wish
    4) Press Next
    5) In the Trigger section, select an appropriate time for the task to be completed
    6) Press Next
    7)In the Action Tab, press Start a program and hit next
    8) Put the output after the Python EXE , and copy into the Program / Script Field (e.g C:\Path\To\Your\Python\Executable)
    9) In the Add Arguments field, put the name of your python program followed by .py
    10)Press Next
    11)Press Finish

After following all these steps, the python program should add a database at a chosen  interval to your archive folder.
